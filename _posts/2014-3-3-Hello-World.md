So HI! I'm learning to program and it is really cool. I also met some 
awesome people at this thing and I'm pretty excited about that. Python was 
kind of confusing but I am hoping I can automate my analysis process for my 
project and I'm totally going to program in public to blow people's minds.

Woohoo!
